Like any good filmmaker, Lokesh Kanagaraj knows that it takes a fearsome antagonist to turn a protagonist into a hero. This is why he begins Master by establishing the myth of his antagonist Bhavani (Vijay Sethupathi). A teenager who is sent to an observation home by the powerful men who had killed his family, Bhavani becomes the very thing that the system doesn't want juveniles to become - a ruthless monster. In one scene, Lokesh even see shows him sporting horns! And he exploits the very system that has made him so, by using juveniles as pawns to establish his criminal enterprise.
This sets up the stage nicely for his protagonist JD (Vijay) to make his entrance. In fact, in classic masala movie fashion, JD's introduction comes right after a character wonders if they would be able to get a brave man to fix things and save the boys from a life of crime.
JD is a professor in a college in Chennai... the kind of professor who has a hip flask ready in his pocket, an advice ready on his lips and a kada ready in his arm for a punch! Naturally, the students adore him, and the management wants to get rid of him. And circumstances lead him to sign up for a teaching role at the observation home, where Bhavani runs the show.
Can this man, who has managed to create a following among youngsters through love, overcome the ghosts of his past and find it in himself to take on the criminal, who has built an army of youngsters through fear?<br>But for some reason, the film feels less punchy that it sounds on paper. The plot points are at times too familiar - like the pre-intermission scenes, where you know the punch that is going to bring up the intermission (a nod to Thuppakki), or the familiar trope of the villain going after the hero's loved ones after being rattled (another sequence that harks back to Thuppakki). The action sequences, which have been a highlight in Lokesh's previous films, are kind of overlong here. One particular sequence, involving JD and his former classmate Vanathi (Andrea) weilding bow and arrows, hardly offers any thrill. For contrast, you only have to look at a similar night-time chase in the director's previous film, Kaithi.
