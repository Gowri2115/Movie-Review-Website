Money talks, especially in the world of professional sports. Top clubs believe dollars buy you dreams. That's why they shell out millions for the superstars. Beane doesn't have the big bucks. And he has just lost three of his marquee players to bigger clubs. "We are like the organ donors for the rich," he tells his scouts. What Beane doesn't lack is commitment to the game and an ambition to beat the best. And pushed into a corner, he is bent on finding a novel -- and economical -- way to do it.
And when he finds Peter Brand (Jonah Hill), a graduate in economics from Yale, with a statistical theory that suits his budget, the two form an unlikely team. Together they recruit a bunch of under-valued players, "misfit toys" who have the potential to be match-winners. That's what the term, moneyball, a much-debated word in baseball, boils down to.
But translating theory into practice isn't easy. After their initial failure, the baseball system is dismissive of Beane and Brand. They have bought tickets on a Titanic, scoffs a critic. And Beane is battling his own private demons of the past too. He is a failed prodigy. And this is his last chance to create a thinking revolution in baseball and prove that money doesn't always talk.
