A man forced to leave home after building a shrine for actress Nayanthara, a driver thrown out of his job at a five-star hotel after driving off in a fancy car belonging to a guest, an IT employee sacked for not succumbing to the whims of a bossy co-worker, a doctor who would rather make films than treat his patients (a la ‘Power Star’) and finally, a schizophrenic kidnapper who keeps talking to an imaginary moll – this is the motley group of characters who populate ‘Soodhu Kavvum’. Into this mix are thrown in a politician for whom nothing matters more than truth and honour, his not-so honest son out to make a quick buck and a cop whose fists talk more than he does. When their paths meet, chaos ensues.
Nalan Kumarasamy establishes himself as a director to watch out for in this laugh riot of a debut movie. Carrying off a dark comedy is no mean task, but Nalan hits the target right in his first attempt. His writing is crisp, the lines are down to earth and funny, the characters well-etched and the screenplay has no dull moments. What’s more, all characters are given due importance and the screen space they require, thanks in part to editor Leo John Paul, but it is the director’s clarity of thought and vision that shines all through.
‘Soodhu Kavvum’ marks a hat-trick of successes for Vijay Sethupathy after the thriller ‘Pizza’ and the situational comedy ‘Naduvula Konjam Pakkatha Kaanom’. His knack of choosing good roles and working with new directors brimming with ideas will stand him in good stead, as also the work he puts in to portray each character. He put on weight and grew a beard to play Das, and the look fits him to a ‘T’. His chemistry with Shalu (Sanchita Shetty), who has a terrific screen presence and does a neat job in her debut movie, is a treat to watch.
In fact, the other debutants, Simha and radio jockey Ramesh Thilak, too come out with good performances, bringing in the laughs at regular intervals with their mannerisms and dialogue delivery. Karunakaran does not have much screen space in the first half, but comes up with a riotous performance in the second half. Veterans M S Bhaskar and Radha Ravi aren’t taxed much, but Yog Japee does a bravura act as the tough as nails Brahma, who gets his comeuppance at his own hands.
Dinesh Krishnan impresses with his camera work, but it is Santosh Narayanan who takes the movie a notch higher with his eclectic background score. Though the movie features only one full song ‘Kaasu panam’, the soundtrack has other gems like ‘Mama douser’ and ‘Come na come’ and a background score that will remain with you long after you exit the theatre. With a smile!!!
