“Shutter Island” stars DiCaprio as Edward “Teddy” Daniels, a U.S. Marshal who is investigating a psychiatric facility on the eponymous island after a patient goes missing. Only Teddy is not a real person but a delusion created by inmate Andrew Laeddis. The ending of “Shutter Island” reveals that DiCaprio’s character is a patient himself, committed to the Shutter Island facility after murdering his wife (Michelle Williams) because she went insane and killed their children. Two doctors, Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley) and Chuck (Mark Ruffalo), created a roleplaying game (the film’s central mystery) in an attempt to break Andrew free from his delusions. The bait-and-switch twist forces the viewer to re-contextualize the entire film up until that point, making “Shutter Island” a rich experience on the second and third watches.
If the “Shutter Island” ending ranks as one of the best twists of the 21st Century, it’s one of Andrew/Teddy’s ambiguous final lines that continue to make it such a haunting and satisfying experience. Several months before DiCaprio and Nolan unleashed the spinning top in “Inception,” DiCaprio and Scorsese dropped this line of dialogue in “Shutter Island”: “Which would be worse: To live as a monster, or to die as a good man?” The line is asked by Andrew/Teddy, and in doing so Scorsese and screenwriter Laeta Kalogridis leave the door somewhat open as to whether or not Andrew/Teddy is committing himself to a lobotomy in order to wash his mind from the sins of his past. It’s an integral tweak from Lehane’s book, which ends more conclusively as Andrew slips back into his Teddy persona. The question Andrew/Teddy asks in the film makes it a possibility that the character has become more sane and is making an active choice. If Andrew is sane, then committing himself to a lobotomy because he can’t deal with the monster he’s become turns “Shutter Island” into a haunting tragedy.
