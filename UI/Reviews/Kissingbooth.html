Director:Vince Marcello

Starring:Joey King,Jacob Elordi,Joel Courtney<br><br>
An appealing cast, idyllic setting, and of course, forbidden romance, provide lots of teen appeal in this quirky romantic comedy. The Kissing Booth keeps the tone light thanks to Elle's engaging narration, which also provides a few laughs along the way. There are some problems with pace, like taking way too long to get to the main conflict, some gaps in the story, and a pretty predictable resolution. But teen romance fans who can handle the edgy content and who can see past the stereotypes will enjoy watching events unfold to the refreshingly not-melodramatic but satisfying end.</P>
